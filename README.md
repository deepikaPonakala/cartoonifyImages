# Cartoonify Images Using Python & OpenCV

Transform ordinary images into cartoon-style artwork using Python, OpenCV, and image processing techniques.
This project provides a simple GUI-based tool to upload an image and instantly convert it into a cartoon version.

# Features

Upload any JPG/PNG image

Convert the image to cartoon style

Save the cartoonified image

Uses OpenCV filters + edge detection

Simple GUI built using Tkinter

Fast and easy to use

Technologies Used
Library	Purpose
OpenCV	Image processing (filters, edge detection)
NumPy	Handling image arrays
Tkinter	GUI for image upload
Python 3.x	Core programming language

# How It Works

The cartoon effect is created by applying:

Bilateral Filtering
Smoothens the image but preserves edges.

Edge Detection
Converts edges into a clean black outline.

Color Quantization
Reduces the number of colors to give the “cartoon” style.

Combining Edges + Smoothed Image

# Installation

Make sure you have Python installed (3.10+ recommended).

Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy

# Usage

Run the script:

python cartoonifier-python-project.py


GUI will open → Click Upload Image → Choose an image → Cartoon version appears.

# Example Output
Original	Cartoonified
